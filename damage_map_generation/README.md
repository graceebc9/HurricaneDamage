Here we generate the damage maps for predictions in the Notebook Generate_damage_maps.ipynb.

Users can update dataset and geo-level to generate maps at different levels. Note that when running block level for datasets 1b, 2a,2b execution can take up to 1 hour. Otherwise generation should be in < 20 mins.
