Model architectures are created in PyTorch Lightning and are stored in src/modules.py. 

Parameter sweeps and predictions were created in Google Colab. To run the following colab notebooks, reader will need to mount their Google Drive and access the data and utilities stored in the following [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b9qMhMblYRnJHzZOqJeFnltUX9jpfLTo?usp=sharing). 

Predictions can be made with the Final model or the Finetuned model using the following [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EQUWDyDrzC-ZCKZ-z6f0sTiqZ1TF0BoX?usp=sharing). If running not on Colab, download the Drive folder linked above and use the script Predictions.ipynb. Base directory variable will need to be updated to the location of the HurricaneDamage_Data folder. 


To train your the Final model on your own data use the following [Colab Notebook].
