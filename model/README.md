Model architectures are created in PyTorch Lightning and are stored in src/modules.py. 

Parameter sweeps and predictions were created in Google Colab. To run the following colab notebooks, reader will need to mount their Google Drive and access the data and utilities stored in the following [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b9qMhMblYRnJHzZOqJeFnltUX9jpfLTo?usp=sharing). 

Predictions can be made with the Final model or the Finetuned model using the script Predictions.ipyn. [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EQUWDyDrzC-ZCKZ-z6f0sTiqZ1TF0BoX?usp=sharing). If running not on colab, base directory variable will need to be updated to the location of the HurricaneDamage folder.
