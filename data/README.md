# Data Access and Dataset Preparation

This section contains details how to access the NOAA aerial imagery, and the Patch Generation process. 

[NOAA_download](https://github.com/graceebc9/HurricaneDamage/tree/main/data/NOAA_download) gives info on accessing the NOAA data

[patch_generation](https://github.com/graceebc9/HurricaneDamage/tree/main/data/patch_generation) contains the methodology for patch generation used in this report. We are not able to publish the damage labels and building footprints we received from RMS so this section is purely for context - example is given for the IDA patches (dataset 1a and 1b) but the same methodology was used to generate the Delta patches (2a and 2b). The processed datasets are available for download at the following [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a34p6M0DopPn3Dv1XgYuJiufT3AA09XA?usp=sharing)
